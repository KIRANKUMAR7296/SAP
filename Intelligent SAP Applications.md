# `Intelligent SAP Applications`

### Learn from human capabilities to support humans.

- Humans have `cognitive` abilities to learn and perform different tasks.
- For machines, this can be replaced by `ML Algorithms` where it can learn from sample datasets. 
- And apply that knowledge for further decision makings such as `predictions`, `classifications`, `recommendations` and `clustering`
- We can also mimic the human's listening and speaking capabilities by using AI bots.
- `Intelligent RPA` can perform human's repetitive acts.

SAP intelligent suite has built in `ML` and `DL` capabilities based on SAP AI business services, technical services of SAP DI, and SAP DI as a platform.

In addition to the `embedded ML` business applications, standalone applications are also available.
